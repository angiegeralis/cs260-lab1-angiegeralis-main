### Analysis

Part 1
explain empty numpy array

Part 2
1) I expect it to return the third row of the array, this makes sense because it is
the second index.
2) I expect it to return the second column, this makes sense because it is returning
the entire list of the first dimension, but only the first index of the 2nd dimension
3) I was not sure what to expect on this one other than some section of the array,
but after running it I see now that it is returning the first two indexes of the rows
of the first three columns.
Part 3
When I set the xlim and ylim to larger numbers the graph looked choppy. I preferred
the smoother graph it gave without limits.
